I have developed another project. In this project, Additionally, I tried saving data in local storage again. And user can easily delete local storage data from the front end.

What I learned from this project:
1. how to set up Tailwind CSS in React JS projects
2. about state lift-up
3. The user can't bookmark that post second time, which already exists on the bookmark.
